# Hand-Drawn-Emoji-Recognition

An implementation for classifying emojis through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks. 

## About the Project

Emojis are icons used to express emotions or feelings through text - be it captions, text messages, comments. They are nowadays very popular especially in social media platforms such as Tiktok, Instagram and communication platforms such as Slack and Discord. Following this, there are not many Hand Drawing Emoji Recognitions around; however, I took on the challenge and built my own HDER. A website using Flask, was used to create a drawing platform for the mimiking of hand-drawing. The HDER returns a <strong>prediction</strong> in real-time.

The emojis that are supported are:

  <img src="Emoji/Frowning-Face.png" width="80" />
